public class Introduction_Arrays {
	//Array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of homogeneous or similar data-type
	//Array is data structure where we store similar elements
	//length of an array is determined at the time of creation and once created the length of the array is fixed.
	//indexing position of an array starts with zero 0
	
	//Features of Array: -
	//1. a java array variable can be declared like other variables with [] 
	//2. the variables in the array are ordered
	//3. indexing begins from 0
	//4. Arrays are objects, so they occupy heap memory
	//5. the direct superclass of an array type is Object
	//6. they are always created at runtime
	//7. the length of an array can be determine used member length
	//8. The elements of an array are stored in consecutive memory locations
	
	//Disadvantages of array :-
	//Fixed Size
	//Memory wastage
	//Strongly typed
	//Reduce performance
	//Arrays do not have any add or remove methods
	
	//Advantages of array: -
	//arrays are used to store multiple data items of same type by using only single name
	//we can access any element randomly by using indexes provided by arrays
	//Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graph, etc
	//Primitive type to wrapper classes object conversion will not happen in case of arrays. So it is fast.
