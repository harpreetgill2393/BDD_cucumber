How to create a Java Project
How to add JAR files
You will write your first Java code
We will write our first automation code


Java Project
  You will have to add JAR files in case it is required
      You shall create packages
        You shall create Classes inside the packages
            You shall write your java code inside the Classes

Save everytime you write a line of code Ctrl+S, Command+S

package Nomenclature -  com.projectname.intentoftheproject

create 3 different projects
in each project you will create 3 different packages
and in each package there will be 3 classes

1st project - 3 packages - 3 classes, total 9 classes

What is the difference between jvm and jdk and jre
JVM: - Java Virtual Machine
------
> integral part of java platform and is responsible for executing java bytecode.
> Developer will write a java program [Certain OS under a certain hardware] - jvm acts as an intermediary between the java program and OS and Hardware
> jvm provides an environment where Java applications can run. regardless of the system they are executed on
> jvm interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code that can be understood by the specific hardware and OS

JRE:- Java Runtime Environment
-----
> it is a software package that includes the JVM, along with other libraries and components which are necessary to run Java applications

JDK: - Java Development Kit
-----
JDK = JRE + JVM
>compilers, debuggers and there are other tools


What is a jar file ?
Java Archive
wrote so many programs - in Java Classes
Classes + associated Metadata + resources (images, audio files, configuration files, etc)

compressed into a single file - Java Archive file

What are the features of Java?
> platform independent (write once run anywhere)
> portable
> secure
> Object Oriented Programming
> Robust
> MultiThreading
> Simple compared to C and C++
